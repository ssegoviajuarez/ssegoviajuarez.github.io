    "Considerable attention has been given to produce reliable poverty maps in off-census years. An updated poverty map is increasingly becoming an essential resource to improve the targeting of many social protection programs around the world, which was underscored by the rapid onset and widespread impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Even in the best-case scenarios, poverty maps that rely on unit-level small area estimation techniques combining a census and survey can only be obtained once a decade. In off-census years, the typical small area approach applied has been an area-level model, such as a Fay-Herriot or a sub-area-level model, such as the one proposed by {cite:t}`torabi2014small`). Nevertheless, since the perceived gains in precision from area-level models are less than stellar, methods that combine unit- and area-level models have been proposed (see {cite:t}`doi:10.1080/00220388.2012.682983`; {cite:t}`lange2018small`; {cite:t}`masaki2020small`). These models are here called unit-context models and, although appealing, seem to yield considerably biased estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the small area estimation literature, the machine learning literature has made several contributions to poverty mapping. Recent research in this area include {cite:t}`chi2021micro` and {cite:t}`jean2016combining`. The authors of these two papers created highly disaggregated poverty maps by modeling the direct estimates of an asset index at a very low geographical level (e.g. villages or enumeration areas) using satellite-derived covariates. The authors of those papers rely on machine learning approaches, such as gradient boosting and ridge regression, to obtain estimates for small areas. These models provide point estimates of poverty at a low geographical level, although they do not necessarily provide an adequate estimate of the method's noise. The methods are attractive since they present the possibility of producing a poverty map even when a contemporaneous or reliable census does not exist.\n"

    "Unit-context models attempt to model the population's welfare distribution using only area-level covariates. More specifically, unit-context models combine unit and area-level information to model the transformed household-level welfare (unit) using only area-level covariates (context). Since unit-context models do not require census microdata, they have been proposed as an alternative approach for the case when the available census microdata is too outdated to be considered for use under the conventional model-based methods that include unit-level covariates.[^1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous applications of unit-context models for small area estimation were proposed by {cite:t}`arora1997empirical`, who studied the number of trips home students have taken, and by {cite:ts}`efron1975data`, who looked at batting averages and toxoplasmosis cases. In these applications, the method appears to work well, although in both studies, the model with aggregate covariates is used to produce estimates of the area means of the dependent variable in the model (no transformation is considered). In the context of poverty, the target poverty indicators are typically complex nonlinear functions of the dependent variables in the model. Hence, properly replicating the full welfare distribution is essential as noted in **{numref}`bias_approx`**. At the area level, this is complicated since household characteristics are not used in the model. Thus very little, if any, of the variation in welfare across households in the area is explained. If simple area means of the welfare variable of interest are the target, then, due to the assumptions embedded into the nested-error models used in **Chapter 4: {ref}`unit-level`**, a transformation (such as log or log-shift) of the welfare variable is used as the dependent variable in the model. Consequently, the area means of the untransformed welfare variable are desired, which are then means of exponentials of the dependent variable. As is illustrated in the next section, when estimating indicators that are nonlinear functions of the dependent variables in the model, unit-context models will likely produce small area estimators of poverty with substantial bias.\n",

    "{cite:t}`doi:10.1080/00220388.2012.682983` first considered unit-context models for poverty estimation in an application for Vietnam. In this application, the dependent variable was the household-level logarithm of per capita expenditure from the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey from 2006, whereas all covariates are commune-level means obtained from a dated (1999) census. {cite:t}`doi:10.1080/00220388.2012.682983` obtains ELL estimates of poverty for small areas under that model and compares the performance with typical ELL poverty estimates obtained using unit-level covariates from the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey from 2006 and the 2006 Rural Agriculture and Fishery Census. The author finds that provinces and districts hovering around the middle of the distribution suffered considerable re-rankings across methods. However, those at the top and the bottom were relatively stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar approach to the one from {cite:t}`doi:10.1080/00220388.2012.682983` was presented by {cite:t}`lange2018small` as an alternative in cases when census and survey data are not from similar periods. However, the same inefficiency issues noted in **Chapter 4: {ref}`unit-level`** regarding ELL estimates would likely persist when considering a model using only area-level covariates. Improvements to the approach were seemingly made by {cite:t}`masaki2020small` by taking measures to address some of the shortcomings of a standard ELL approach and to obtain EB estimators from {cite:t}`molina2010small`. The authors conduct a design-based validation study using census data for Sri Lanka and Tanzania for a wealth index constructed by principal component analysis and suggest that the use of EB improves precision over ELL when implementing unit-context models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the unit-context approach is attractive in that it does not require a contemporaneous census and can readily accommodate variables extracted from the emerging fields related to geospatial analysis, there are serious concerns about bias in unit-context estimators, as noted in {cite:t}`corral2021map` as well as the concerns raised in the following section. The MSE from unit-context models is also likely to be incorrectly estimated since the required parametric bootstrap procedure assumes the underlying model using only area-level characteristics to be correct. In other words, the unit-context model's assumptions require household-level welfare to not depend on household-specific characteristics, which is unlikely to be the case. Incorrect MSE estimates risk presenting a map with considerable bias as being overly precise. Therefore, based on the currently available evidence, area-level models, like Fay-Herriot (**Chapter 3: {ref}`area-level`**), are generally preferred over unit-context models (see the following section for more details).\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where neither area- nor unit-level models are advised due to data limitations, no clear consensus has emerged on the best path forward or if one even exists. In evaluating alternatives, practitioners should choose methods which rely on assumptions that are realistic to the circumstances in which the model will be employed, which are approximately unbiased (or its bias does not exceed a certain limit), and for which an accurate method exists to measure the small area estimators' MSE. In cases where the MSE cannot be adequately estimated, then at least it should be known in which (realistic) scenarios the approach has limited bias. If these conditions cannot be reasonably met, it is preferable to not produce a map than to produce one with potentially biased estimates, or one in which precision is overestimated, or most worrisome, both. In the next section, the limitations of unit-context models are discussed."

    "In the simulation results displayed in **{numref}`uc_mean`**, the dependent variable is the natural log of welfare. Nevertheless, what practitioners are often interested in is welfare, and hence need to reverse the log transformation. Since $\\exp\\left[E\\left(\\ln y\\right)\\right]\\neq E\\left(y\\right)$. The log linear nested-error model ($\\ln y_{ch}=x_{ch}\\beta+\\eta_{c}+e_{ch}$) implies that $y_{ch}=\\exp\\left(x_{ch}\\beta\\right)\\exp\\left(\\eta_{c}\\right)\\exp\\left(e_{ch}\\right)$, then $E\\left(y_{ch}|x_{ch}\\right)=\\exp\\left(x_{ch}\\beta\\right)E\\left[\\exp\\left(\\eta_{c}\\right)\\right]E\\left[\\exp\\left(e_{ch}\\right)\\right]$. Since it is assumed that $\\eta_{c}\\sim N\\left(0,\\sigma_{\\eta}^{2}\\right)$ and $e_{ch}\\sim N\\left(0,\\sigma_{e}^{2}\\right)$, then $E\\left[\\exp\\left(\\eta_{c}\\right)\\right]=\\exp\\left(0.5\\sigma_{\\eta}^{2}\\right)$ and $E\\left[\\exp\\left(e_{ch}\\right)\\right]=\\exp\\left(0.5\\sigma_{e}^{2}\\right)$. Because unit-context models do not include household-level covariates, the resulting estimate of $\\sigma_{e}^{2}$ is likely much greater than the true $\\sigma_{e}^{2}$. This implies that unit-context models may yield an upward biased prediction of mean household welfare for the area despite the use of EB methods since unbiasedness is assured for the area means of $\\ln y$ but not for those of $y$ following back transformation.\n",

This is done to remove the potential source of bias noted in the Appendix of {cite:t}`corral2021map`. The empirical bias of the estimators in each of the 40 areas in the census data set are represented in box-plots. First, note that, when estimating the area means of the dependent variable (similar to when no transformation is taken), the biases of the CensusEB estimators based on the unit-context model are not that large (**{numref}`mypop_welfare_bias`**, left). However, suppose one estimates the means of the untransformed welfare variable (exponential of the model's dependent variable). In that case, the incorrect estimate of $\\sigma_{\\eta}^{2}+\\sigma_{e}^{2}$ plays a considerable role, and thus the estimates of mean welfare based on unit-context models are upward biased despite the use of EB methods (**{numref}`mypop_welfare_bias`**, right). As shown in **{numref}`mypop_welfare_bias`** (right), the average bias of CensusEB estimators based on unit-context models is considerable. For some areas, the bias may be over 800 times the bias of the CensusEB estimators based on the analogous unit-level models."

To address the low $R^{2}$, the simulation experiment is repeated using a slightly modified data generating process leading to an increase of the model's $R^{2}$ (Technical Annex **{numref}`off-census:appendix:experiment1`**). This modification leads to an $R^{2}$ of the unit-context model between 0.15 and 0.20, while for the unit-level model the $R^{2}$ exceeds 0.60. This adjustment in the data generating process reduces the bias in the estimators of mean welfare based on the unit-context model (**{numref}`2_mean_bias`**), but the direction of the bias is different from that of the original simulation (**{numref}`uc_mean`**). This change of direction of the bias also occurs when estimating poverty rates, and the direction of the bias seems to change with the poverty threshold. Estimators based on unit-context models are upward biased for poverty rates under a threshold of 13. If this threshold is increased to 28, the unit-context estimators of the poverty rate become downward biased for every area (**{numref}`2_fgt0_bias`**). These results illustrate a crucial shortcoming of unit-context models: in a given application, a practitioner cannot know which will be the direction and the magnitude of the bias.

    "Summarizing concerns with unit-context models, given the limitations of unit-context models, even under an ideal scenario where the model is fit to the whole set of population data and EB estimates are obtained also using the population data, unit-context models should be considered only if unit-level and area-level options have been exhausted. While it is possible that in real world applications, there may be bias from multiple sources which offset each other out for a given poverty threshold, there is no way for an analyst to determine if biases are canceling or compounding each other as the direction of the bias is not known *a priori*. A likely overstatement of precision further complicates this unknown bias. This situation recalls an original concern levied against ELL by {cite:t}`banerjee2006evaluation` where the authors state: \"What we are most concerned about is the possibility that the Bank is making very attractive poverty maps, whose precision is not known, but which come with statements of precision that we suspect may be seriously misleading. In the worst case scenario, a map that may be worthless is presented as one that is extremely precise\" ({cite:t}`banerjee2006evaluation`, pg 61)."

    "With the advent of increased computing power, machine learning approaches have gained popularity in the literature as well as in policy circles. For example, poverty estimates for small areas derived from a gradient boosting application by {cite:t}`chi2021micro` guided the expansion of social protection in Nigeria; specifically, the estimates were used as an input to the Rapid Response Register for the COVID-19 Cash Transfer Project.[^4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting methods rely on, first, creating a linear fit (usually a constant term) to the data at hand and then fitting a new model onto the residuals. In contrast to ensemble techniques, the multiple fits are not averaged. Instead, the predicted residuals (scaled by a learning rate) are added to the previous step's prediction, successively taking small steps using the same or different covariates at each step toward the final prediction. This process repeats until the requested number of predictions are completed, or there is no longer a gain in prediction.[^5] A complete exposition of the approach is beyond the scope of the Guidelines, and interested readers can refer to {cite:t}`natekin2013gradient` or {cite:t}`chen2016xgboost` for a more nuanced description of the approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "A validation approach similar to the one done by {cite:t}`corral2021map` is implemented to test how well gradient boosting works in a poverty mapping context. Specifically, 500 samples taken from the census created from the *Mexican Intercensal Survey* are used to conduct a design-based simulation experiment to validate the method.[^6] The *Mexican Intercensal Survey* is uniquely suited for this validation since it includes a measure of income at the household level and is representative at the municipal level and localities with 50,000 or more inhabitants. The survey was modified to obtain a census dataset of 3.9 million households and 1,865 municipalities {cite:t}`corral2021map`. Using a sampling approach similar to the one used for Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) surveys, 500 samples are drawn from the resulting census.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of the 500 samples, a model is fit. The model's dependent variable is the direct estimator of the headcount poverty rate at the PSU level (or municipality), and PSU aggregates (or municipality) from the census data are used as covariates. The models are fit using the XGBoost algorithm available in Python and R.[^7] Introduced by {cite:t}`chen2016xgboost`, XGBoost is a scalable machine learning system for tree boosting and is available as an open-source software library. To make the comparison fair, for each of the 500 samples, a model is selected using lasso regression as detailed in **{numref}`diagnostics:selection`** and fit for the considered small area estimation methods. This is different from the approach usually taken under design-based validation, where one model is considered the true model and is used across all samples. The results for the XGBoost and the SAE methods are illustrated in **{numref}`xgboost`**. The results illustrate that in the case of the Mexican data, XGBoost yields unbiased estimates of poverty. Moreover, the empirical MSE compares favorably with that of CensusEB methods, which are more computational and data-intensive. Additionally, in this Mexican scenario, the gradient boosted estimates are superior to those from the unit-context method discussed in the previous section (labeled U-C CensusEB)."

    "The production of estimators based on unit-context models is similar to those using regular unit-level models, except that unit-level covariates are not used. This implies that the share of welfare variation across households explained by the model's covariates is expected to be lower and, within many areas, welfare may be poorly explained. Still, unit-context models may be regarded as an approximation to the true underlying data generating process. Actually, they are particular cases of unit-level models (**Equation {eq}`eq:1-1`**); consequently, normality and linearity assumptions need to be checked similarly with the corresponding covariates. The focus of this section is on the unit-context models as presented in {cite:t}`masaki2020small` and not those from {cite:t}`lange2018small` and {cite:t}`doi:10.1080/00220388.2012.682983`. The reason for this choice is that {cite:t}`lange2018small` and {cite:t}`doi:10.1080/00220388.2012.682983` approach relies on ELL's method, which suffers from the same issues noted by previous work (see {cite:t}`molina2010small`; {cite:t}`corral2020pull`; {cite:t}`corral2021map` among others). In addition, {cite:t}`masaki2020small` tested different methods, including EB, and concluded that EB provides a considerable gain in accuracy and efficiency over other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit-context versions (i.e. those with aggregated covariates only) may be specified for either a one-fold nested-error model or a two-fold nested-error model. A possible unit-context model follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{sach}=z_{sac}\\alpha+t_{sa}\\omega+g_{s}\\lambda+\\eta_{sa}+\\varepsilon_{sach}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s$ is used for an aggregation level that is over the target areas (a super-area), and $c$ is used for subareas. Hence, $z_{sac}$ contains subarea-level characteristics, $t_{sa}$ includes area-level characteristics and $g_{s}$ is composed of super-area-level characteristics (which may include super-area fixed effects). The regression coefficients across these levels are respectively denoted $\\alpha,$ $\\omega$ and $\\lambda$. The random effects, $\\eta_{sa}$, are specified in this model at the area level. Note that, among the set of covariates in this model, none is at the unit level; covariates only vary at the subarea level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection may be implemented following the approach described in **{numref}`diagnostics:selection`**, except that only contextual variables will be among the pool of eligible covariates. Data transformation is also important in unit-context models and is emphasized by {cite:t}`masaki2020small`. In contrast to the data transformation used in **{numref}`diagnostics:selection`** recommend transforming the dependent variable with ordered quantile normalization. Nevertheless, this transformation cannot be used for the most common poverty and inequality indicators beyond headcount poverty because the transformation is not reversible. EB point and noise estimates are obtained following a Monte Carlo simulation and parametric bootstrap procedures, respectively, similar to the conventional application of the EB method under a unit-level model and detailed in the technical annex (**{numref}`unit-level:annex:montecarlo:molina`** and **{numref}`unit-level:annex:montecarlo:bootstrap`**). Finally, {cite:t}`masaki2020small` also recommend adjusting the model-based estimators to match direct estimates, usually to the level where the survey is representative (benchmarking).\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarking is not recommended unless publication requirements include that estimates of totals at a lower aggregation level add up to the estimated total at a higher level (e.g., the national level). The need to benchmark due to substantial discrepancies between the sum of estimated totals at the lower level and the estimated total at the higher level may indicate that the model assumptions are not satisfied. EB estimators based on a correct model are approximately model-unbiased and optimal in terms of minimizing the MSE for a given area; thus, when adjusted afterwards for benchmarking, so that these match usual estimates at higher aggregation levels, the optimal properties are lost and estimators usually become worse in terms of bias and MSE under the model.[^10] When benchmarking adjustments are large, as those likely required by estimators derived from unit-context model variants, it is an indication that the model does not hold for the data. Note that a significant bias in the final estimates may lead to considerable re-ranking of locations in terms of poverty estimates. Consequently, a limit on the acceptable bias should usually be determined according to needs. This is particularly important when determining priorities across areas based on small area estimates. If an area's true poverty rate is 50% and the method yields an estimator of 10% due to an incorrect model, there is a real risk that this area may not be assisted when needed. {cite:t}`molina2019desagregacion` suggests 5 or 10 percent of absolute relative bias as an acceptable threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional problem for unit-context models in many applications is that it may not be possible to match census and survey PSUs. In some cases, it is due to confidentiality reasons and, in others, it is due to different sampling frames. The latter problem will likely affect applications where the census and survey correspond to different years. Fay-Herriot and other area or subarea models that use the same aggregated variables are an alternative approach to unit-context models for the case where the census is outdated, for which the model is not necessarily in question, since these models may be correctly specified. Of course, model checking is also needed."

    "One could argue that, in this scenario, the $R^{2}$ of unit-context models is much lower than that one in the applications of {cite:t}`masaki2020small` and of {cite:t}`lange2018small`. For this reason, the simulation experiment is repeated modifying slightly the data generating process to increase the $R^{2}$. Specifically, in this experiment, the covariate $x_{7}$ is now generated from a random Poisson variable with mean $\\lambda=3\\left(\\frac{c}{20}-\\frac{a}{100}+u\\right)$, where $u$ is a random uniform value between 0 and 1, and $\\sigma_{e}$ is increased from 0.5 to 0.6. This modification leads to an $R^{2}$ of the unit-context model between 0.15 and 0.20, while for unit-level models the $R^{2}$ exceeds 0.60. The Stata script to replicate these simulations can be found in the following **{numref}`off-census:appendix:experiment1:better-fit`**."

    "To further explore the bias of unit-context models and compare its performance to other methods, a final simulation is conducted following the data generation procedure used in **{numref}`off-census:appendix:experiment1:better-fit`**, but with some modifications. Firstly, the population size is $N=500,000$, and the observations are allocated among $A=100$ areas $\\left(a=1,\\ldots,A\\right)$. Within each area $a$, observations are uniformly allocated over $C_{a}=20$ clusters $\\left(c=1,\\ldots,C_{a}\\right)$. Each cluster $c$ consists of $N_{ac}=250$ observations. In this simulation experiment, we take a simple random sample of $n_{ac}=10$ households per cluster, and this sample is kept fixed across simulations. Using a sample, we can also compare with estimators based on FH model (discussed in **Chapter 3: {ref}`area-level`**). T he model that generates the population data contains both cluster and area effects. Cluster effects are simulated as $\\eta_{ac}\\stackrel{iid}{\\sim}N\\left(0,0.1\\right)$, area effects as $\\eta_{a}\\stackrel{iid}{\\sim}N\\left(0,0.15^{2}\\right)$ and household specific residuals as $e_{ach}\\overset{iid}{{\\sim}}N\\left(0,0.5^{2}\\right)$, where $h=1,\\ldots,N_{ac}$, $c=1,\\ldots,C_{a}$, $a=1,\\ldots,A$. Finally, $x_{7}$ is generated from a random Poisson variable with mean $\\lambda=3\\left(\\frac{c}{20}-\\frac{a}{100}+u\\right)$, where $u$ is a random uniform value between 0 and 1. In this experiment, we take a grid of 99 poverty thresholds, corresponding to the 99 percentiles of the very first population generated. In total, 1,000 populations are generated. In each of the 1,000 populations, the following quantities are computed in every area for each of the 99 poverty lines:\n",

The $R^{2}$ for this model is roughly 0.60.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Unit-context CensusEB estimators $\\hat{\\tau}_{a}^{UC-CEB_{a}}$ based on a nested-error model with random effects at the **area-level** obtained using a Monte Carlo approximation with $M=50$ replicates. This estimator follows the approach of Masaki et al. {cite:t}`masaki2020small` and uses a model selected using lasso, as described in **{numref}`diagnostics:selection`**. The $R^{2}$ of the resulting model hovers around 0.17.\n",
