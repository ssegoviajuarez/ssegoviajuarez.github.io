    "The objective of model selection is to determine the relevant covariates out of a pool of candidate model variables such that the resulting SAE model generates the most precise estimates possible, noting that it must be possible to measure this precision accurately. Classic approaches to model selection include lasso or stepwise regression. Other literature on the subject includes the fence method, described in {cite:t}`pfeffermann2013new`, which involves selecting a model out of a subgroup of correct models that fulfill specific criteria. {cite:t}`rao2015small` also elaborate on other methods such as Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) type methods, which rely on the marginal restricted log likelihood based on normality of the random effects and the errors. For variable selection under area-level models, particularly Fay-Herriot models, {cite:t}`lahiri2015variable` propose a method where the approximation error converges to zero in probability for large sample sizes.[^2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the aim is to arrive at the \"true\" model, removing all non-significant covariates from the model is recommended as these may introduce noise. It is important not to confuse the estimated noise and the true noise of a given small area estimate. The most common uncertainty measure for an area-specific prediction is the MSE ({cite:t}`tzavidis2018start`). In applications of SAE, such as those illustrated for unit-level models, an estimate of the MSE for the small area estimator is obtained through a parametric bootstrap procedure (see **{numref}`unit-level:annex:montecarlo:bootstrap`**). This method differs considerably from the method used in the ELL method, where a single computational algorithm is used to obtain predictors and assess uncertainty. {cite:t}`corral2020pull`, through model-based simulations, present evidence of the fact that the single computational algorithm to estimate noise used in ELL could underestimate the actual MSE of the method.[^3]\n",
    "\n",
    "The script example provided in **{numref}`unit-level:appendix:selection`** uses a lasso approach for model selection that initially includes all suitable covariates and uses 10 fold cross-validation with a shrinkage parameter $\\lambda$ that is within one standard error of the one that minimizes the cross-validated average prediction squared error. The lasso approach employed here does not consider the nested-error structure of the model; that is, it is done with the corresponding linear model without the random area effects. Practitioners who are comfortable with R may rely on the `glmmlasso` R package, which may be used for model selection in the model with the assumed nested-error structure (see {cite:t}`groll2014variable` and {cite:t}`groll2017glmmlasso`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The lasso selection process yields a selected set of covariates, although some of the included covariates may be non-significant. Consequently, the next step is to remove all the non-significant covariates sequentially. The process starts by removing the most non-significant covariates, one by one. When a covariate is removed, the significance of other covariates may change; thus, after removing each covariate, the model is fit again to determine which covariate to remove next until the remaining ones are all significant. Note that the process used here ignores the magnitude of the coefficients and thus could be further improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is recommended to remove highly collinear covariates. Once these are removed, the following steps are to identify outliers and influential observations, which may lead to considerably different estimated model parameters, see the next section. For the Fay-Herriot model of **Chapter 3: {ref}`area-level`** a different approach than the one detailed here was taken. In the implemented approach for area-level models, the model started with all possible covariates and began removing covariates, starting with the least significant ones. The removal was done considering the random effects (see **{numref}`area-level:first-sae`**).\n"

    "After the fitting process, checking whether the assumptions from the underlying model are satisfied is recommended. Regression diagnostics for Linear Mixed Models (LMM)[^4] are more difficult to interpret than those of the standard linear models, since these models include random effects, which lead to a different covariance structure. Moreover, tools for diagnostics of linear mixed models are less common in software packages, including Stata. Thus, practitioners either must code their own diagnostics or rely on diagnostics often used for linear regression. The model assumptions to keep in mind are: [^5]\n",

Homoskedasticity: errors' variance $\\sigma_{e}^{2}$ is constant, although this assumption may be relaxed by modeling heteroskedasticity using a model such as the alpha model specification provided by ELL ({cite:t}`elbers2003micro`). This can be done when choosing Henderson's Method III fitting in Stata's `sae` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Independence: errors $e_{ch}$ are independently distributed. Under the nested-error model, the assumption is extended so that $e_{ch}$ in location $c$ is unrelated to the corresponding location effect $\\eta_{c}$, as well as to all other location effects $\\eta_{l,}\\:l\\neq c$.\n",

    "The following subsections include some formal and informal ways to check if the assumptions of the underlying model are satisfied.

    "Collinearity reduces the accuracy of estimates of regression coefficients, leading to larger standard errors of the coefficients. Under the multiple imputation (MI) inspired bootstrap methods, such as the one often used in the ELL method (see **Chapter 4: {ref}`unit-level`**), larger standard errors in the coefficients typically led to larger estimates of noise for the estimators of the indicators of interest. Thus, care was taken to avoid collinearity and multicollinearity. A simple way to detect collinearity is via a correlation matrix, where large absolute correlation coefficients may suggest collinearity problems ({cite:t}`james2013introduction`). However, collinearity may occur between more than a pair of variables leading to multicollinearity, which cannot be detected under the pairwise correlation matrix (*ibid*).\n",

The smallest possible value for a VIF is 1. There are multiple rules of thumb as to what is an acceptable VIF. According to {cite:t}`james2013introduction`, values exceeding 5 or 10 may require action. After the model is fit, the command `estat vif` may be used to check the variance inflation factor for the covariates included in the model."

    "Influence analysis is used to detect observations that may have considerable impact on the estimates of the parameters and, consequently, model predictions. These observations include outliers (observations with a large residual, i.e., an observation poorly predicted by the model) and influential observations (the omission of which considerably changes the point estimates of $\\beta$). These observations can be identified by measuring how far the observation's value for a predictor variable is from the mean or by the size of their studentized residual. Influence analysis is recommended prior to calculating any small area estimate, as these observations may impact the bias and noise of the final small area estimates.\n",

    "Cook's distance ({cite:t}`cook1977detection`), also known as Cook's D, measures the effect on the estimated coefficients when an observation is left out or deleted ({cite:t}`rao2015small`). Under ordinary least squares regression, Cook's distance can be obtained in Stata with the `cooksd` option after the `predict` command. Nevertheless, under regular OLS, Cook's distance focuses solely on isolated observations, whereas, under the nested-error model used for SAE shown in **Equation {eq}`eq:1-1-1-1`**, the analysis of the influence of particular locations may be more relevant. The Stata package `mlt` by {cite:t}`mohring2013mlt` may be used to assess the influence on the estimated parameters of particular locations or groups.[^9] The `mlt` command estimates Cook's D empirically, making it computationally intensive. The rule of thumb for classifying influential locations is absolute Cook's D values greater than $4/C,$ where $C$ is the number of locations into which the population is divided. The `mlt` command will also calculate DFBETAs, which measure the influence of a single location on the coefficient of each covariate. It represents the standardized difference between the coefficient with and without the given location ({cite:t}`mohring2013mlt`). The rule of thumb for classifying locations as influential is a DFBETA absolute value above $2/\\sqrt{C}$, although this should be applied with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leverage measures the influence on the fitted values of a given observation. Unfortunately, data packages that can obtain leverage under the assumed model are not available. {cite:t}`cameron2005microeconometrics` present an alternative toward handling influential observations under OLS by using the post estimation command `dfits`, which shows the difference in fits (predictions) with and without the unusual observation. The command combines outliers and leverage into a single statistic. A rule of thumb to identify these observations is if $|dfits|>2\\sqrt{k/n}$, where $k$ is the number of covariates and $n$ is the number of observations. Nevertheless, the removal of observations always entails loss of information (which may be fair) and thus much care should be taken before deciding on removal, and should be done only when, after inspecting the offender, it is determined to be mistaken."

Deviations from normality may lead to considerable bias in the final small area estimates. Scatter plots of residuals against fitted values and normal Q-Q plots of residuals provide a natural way to identify outliers or influential observations that might affect the precision of the estimates. {cite:t}`west2014linear` mention that the random effects vector is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. Thus, the information from the observations sharing the same random effect is used to predict (instead of estimating) the values of that random effect in the model.\n",
