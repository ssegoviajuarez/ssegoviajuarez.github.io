    "To fully benefit from the Guidelines, it is necessary first to understand the background materials, including a description of the design-based setting, followed by typical direct estimators, along with the advantages and disadvantages of their applications. The goal of **Chapter 2: {ref}`direct`** is to present background material for the chapters that follow. The chapter begins by describing the design-based setting. Then it gives a description of the typical direct estimators and their advantages and disadvantages in their applications. Finally, some tips to evaluate estimates are provided.\n",

    "Direct estimates are generated by taking a sample from the target universe of observations, surveying that sample, then using statistical techniques to generalize the results to the entire population of interest. Sample surveys provide reliable estimates of a target population without observing the entire population. Sample survey data is used to produce direct estimates of totals, means, and other characteristics for the whole population and other domains. Here, \"direct\" means that only the sample units from the area are used (See {cite:t}`lohr2010sampling` or {cite:t}`cochran2007sampling` for a thorough treatment of sampling theory and direct estimation).\n",
    "\n",
    "In areas with a sufficiently large sample size, statistical institutes often report direct estimates by default due to their desirable properties with respect to the sampling design ({cite:t}`molina2019desagregacion`). Though there are some global norms, defining \"sufficiently large,\" usually measured by the coefficient of variation, is done by the data producers. In cases where direct estimates are not sufficiently large, the results may still be reported, but the lack of quality is usually flagged for users. In instances where the desired quality is not met, small area estimates are necessary. Hence, small area estimates may be judged by how much they improve the quality of the direct estimates."

    "The traditional way to provide estimates of finite population parameters based on survey data is to rely on design-based (or repeated sampling) estimation methods. However, using a survey to produce direct estimates of adequate precision for particular domains of the population can be economically prohibitive since it may require considerably large sample sizes ({cite:t}`cochran2007sampling`). Even in the case of limitless resources, huge samples may not be advisable because of a heightened risk of non-sampling or implementation error. The quality of direct design-based estimates is evaluated with respect to their sampling design, that is, with respect to all the possible samples taken from the population under the proposed sampling design ({cite:t}`molina2019desagregacion`).

Nevertheless, for the CV to have a correct interpretation, the value of the estimate must be greater than zero. Moreover, when estimating a proportion $P$ (poverty rates, for example), larger sample sizes are often necessary to keep the error measure below a certain limit than the sample size required when estimating totals ({cite:t}`molina2019desagregacion`).[^6] Since the CV increases as the proportion $P$ decreases, the CV is no longer a measure of the relative error but a measure of how small the proportion $P$ is.
