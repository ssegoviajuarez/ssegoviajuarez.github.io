    "This chapter focuses on the application of the basic area-level models for small area estimation, using Fay and Herriot's ({cite:t}`fay1979estimates`) model as an example. Following a brief introduction, the next section provides an example of an application of the Fay-Herriot Model for small area estimation. Then the advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed. Finally, a technical appendix for the methodology is provided.

    "In the context of poverty, methods based on area-level models typically rely on estimating the distribution of the target area-level poverty indicator, given a set of area-level covariates based on two models -- a sampling model for direct area estimates of poverty and a linking model where the true indicator is linearly related to a vector of auxiliary variables across all areas (see Technical appendix in this chapter).\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to unit-level methods, these methods do not require unit record (most commonly household level) census data since they use only auxiliary information aggregated to the area level. Not typically subject to confidentiality concerns, aggregated data are usually more available. Such is often the case with population census data, where aggregated estimates for localities may be readily available while the detailed household-level data are restricted. Beyond censuses, data from other sources, such as administrative records, remote sensing data, and previous census aggregates, may also be available at the level of the areas or can be readily aggregated to that level and may be included as covariates in an area-level model. Aggregated data are also less sensitive to unit-level outliers. However, if there is high heterogeneity within the geographic units at which the area models are estimated, these benefits are balanced by a substantial loss of information when unit record level data are aggregated. Ultimately, whether unit record-level models offer a greater degree of precision depends on the explanatory power of the covariates that can be included in the area-level and unit-level models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular area-level model is the Fay-Herriot (FH) model, introduced by {cite:t}`fay1979estimates` to estimate the mean per capita income in small places in the United States of America (USA). The U.S. Census Bureau has regularly used it within the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) project to produce estimates for counties and states of the total number of people in poverty by age groups, household median income, and mean per capita income (see {cite:t}`bell1997models`). The U.S. Department of Education uses these estimates to determine annual allocations of federal funds given to school districts. Several other studies have employed area-level models to obtain poverty estimates in small areas around the world. {cite:t}`molina_morales2009` used these models to obtain estimates for Spanish provinces, {cite:ts}`moldova` in Moldova, {cite:t}`casas2016poverty` in Chile, as well as {cite:t}`seitz2019they` which applies the FH model to obtain district-level estimates of poverty in Central Asian countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensions of the basic FH model to account for temporal and spatial correlation have also been considered in the poverty mapping context, although not explored in these Guidelines. Interested readers may refer to {cite:t}`esteban2012small` and {cite:t}`esteban2012two`, who used the FH model with temporal correlation first proposed by {cite:t}`rao1994small` to estimate small area poverty indicators. {cite:t}`giusti2017local` used a spatial FH model to estimate mean income and poverty rates for the 57 Labor Local Systems of the Tuscany region in Italy for the year 2011. {cite:t}`marhuenda2013small` considered a spatio-temporal model to estimate poverty indicators for Spanish provinces in 2008, making use of survey data from the years 2004-2008."

    "The first step towards obtaining small area estimates based on the FH model is to compute direct estimates. For the purpose of this exercise, a 1 percent SRS sample within municipalities was drawn from the *Mexican intracensal survey* of 2015 (Encuesta Intercensal). To obtain direct estimates with correctly calculated standard errors from a complex sample, it is necessary to input the structure by specifying the stratification and clustering used. Complex survey designs usually include a minimum of two clusters per stratum to permit the estimation of sampling variance using standard procedures, but as SAE reports results for areas below which the sample was originally designed, there may be areas represented in the sample by just one PSU; in such cases, the usual variance estimates cannot be computed and it may be necessary to obtain an estimate of the sampling variance via alternative methods. This is a clear limitation of the FH method.[^1] Another limitation of the method is that, in locations with small sample size, everyone may be poor or no one is poor, which leads to an estimated variance of 0. In this case, the FH model is not directly applicable in those locations unless another method is used to predict those variances. The Stata script below describes how to obtain direct estimates of poverty rates $\\hat{\\tau}_{d}^{DIR}$ and their sampling variances $\\psi_{d}$ for each location $d$ in the sample:"

    "With the direct survey estimates $\\hat{\\tau}_{d}^{DIR}$ of the indicators $\\tau_{d}$ in hand, it is possible to produce new estimates of $\\tau_{d}$ based on the fitted model. This model takes as an input, apart from the direct estimates for each location, $\\hat{\\tau}_{d}^{DIR}$, their corresponding (heteroskedastic) sampling variances $\\psi_{d}$, which are assumed known, and the aggregated values of the covariates $\\mathbf{x}_{d}$. This information is used to estimate the FH regression coefficients $\\beta$ and the variance of the area effects $u_{d}$, $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$. There are multiple approaches to predict the unknown random effects of the model, $u_{d}$, in **Equation {eq}`eq:FHmodel`**. Stata's `fhsae `package ({cite:t}`corral2018fhsae`)[^2] obtains estimates similar to those provided from the `eblupFH()` function of  {cite:t}`molina2015sae` R `sae` package, while the `fayherriot` package in Stata by {cite:t}`halbmeier2019fayherriot` is an excellent alternative since it offers transformations to the data to ensure the assumptions of the model are met. The available model-fitting methods in the `fhsae` package are maximum likelihood (ML), restricted maximum likelihood (REML), and an approach presented by {cite:t}`fay1979estimates` based on the method of moments. As noted by {cite:t}`molina2019desagregacion`, REML corrects the ML estimate of $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ by the degrees of freedom due to estimating the regression coefficients, $\\beta$, and yields a less biased estimator in finite samples; thus REML is used in the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final estimate of the target indicator $\\tau_{d}$ is the empirical best linear unbiased (EBLUP) predictor of $\\tau_{d}$ under the FH model. This estimator uses the estimated value $\\hat{\\sigma}_{u}^{2}$ of $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ and can be expressed as a weighted average between the direct estimator and the regression-synthetic estimator $\\mathbf{x}'_{d}\\hat{\\beta}$ as noted by {cite:t}`rao2015small`. The final EBLUP referred to as FH estimator, is given by $\\hat{\\tau}_{d}^{FH}=\\hat{\\gamma}_{d}\\hat{\\tau}_{d}^{DIR}+\\left(1-\\hat{\\gamma}_{d}\\mathbf{x}'_{d}\\hat{\\beta}\\right)$. In this estimator, the weight attached to the direct estimator $\\hat{\\tau}_{d}^{DIR}$ is given by $\\hat{\\gamma}_{d}=\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_{u}^{2}}{\\hat{\\sigma}_{u}^{2}+\\psi_{d}}$ which lies between 0 and 1 and decreases in the error variance, $\\psi_{d}$. In locations $d$ with small sample size and consequently where the direct estimator has a large sampling variance, $\\psi_{d},$ or when the auxiliary information in the model yields good explanatory power, a higher weight is assigned to the corresponding synthetic estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script illustrating model selection and small area estimation based on FH is provided below. Although there are options such as stepwise or lasso regression, it is preferable to use methods that consider the random effects ({cite:t}`lahiri2015variable`). The method for variable selection used in the script considers the random effects and is similar in spirit to a stepwise regression. Initially, the random effect model is fit including all the covariates. Due to lower computational requirements, the process employs the feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) method from {cite:t}`chandra2013small`. Non-significant covariates are removed from the model sequentially, starting with those with the largest p-values.[^3] Then, from the remaining covariates, those with a variance inflation factor (VIF) above five are similarly removed. Finally, it is also essential to check that the model's assumptions hold. In this case, the model residuals are relatively well aligned to the theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution, although some outliers are present (**{numref}`qq-area`**)."

    "\n",
    "2.  The regression model incorporates unexplained heterogeneity between areas through the area effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The FH estimator is a weighted average of the direct estimator and the regression synthetic estimator (i.e., obtained by a linear regression). For areas where the sample size is small or where direct estimators have considerable sampling variance, the synthetic estimator will be given a higher weight. Accordingly, the FH estimate will approximate the direct estimate in areas with a sufficient sample .\n",

    "4.  Since the FH estimates make use of the direct estimates, which consider sampling weights with $\\gamma_{d}$ tending to one as the area sample size increases, it is consistent under the sampling design. Hence, provided that the sampling weights are accurate, FH estimates will be less affected by informative sampling (i.e., when the selection of the units for the sample depends on the outcome values - {cite:t}`rao2015small`.\n",

    "\n",
    "4.  The model is fit only on sampled areas, which can be a very small number out of the total number of areas using only one observation by area (the direct estimator). As a consequence, model parameter estimators will be much less efficient than those obtained under unit-level models, and hence gains in precision are expected to be lower than those of estimators based on unit-level models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Every indicator requires its own model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Once estimates are obtained, these cannot be further disaggregated unless a new model at that level is constructed.\n",

    "In this section, the focus has been on Stata's `fhsae` package. However, there is a wide variety of packages available in R for small area estimation based on the basic FH area-level model and on some extensions of this model proposed in the literature. Below is a list of some of these extensions of the FH model and the corresponding software implementation:[^5]\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The extension of the FH model proposed by {cite:t}`rao1994small` that incorporates temporal correlation is implemented in the` saery` package in R by {cite:t}`lefler2014saery`. R's `sae` package by {cite:t}`molina2015sae` includes a FH model with temporal and spatial correlation. Spatial correlation is also included in R's `emdi` package ({cite:t}`kreutzmann2019r`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Robust alternatives to the basic FH model, as well as its extensions, including spatial and temporal correlation, are detailed in {cite:t}`warnholz2016small` and implemented in R's `saeRobust` package ({cite:t}`warnholzsaerobust`). The robust spatial correlation model is also available in the `emdi` package in R ({cite:t}`kreutzmann2019r`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  In applications with several dependent target indicators, multivariate versions of the FH model may help provide even more efficient estimators. A multivariate version of the FH model was originally proposed by {cite:t}`fay1987application`, and has been used to improve the estimates of median income of four-person families by using direct estimators of median income for three and five-person families by {cite:t}`datta1991hierarchical` and {cite:t}`datta1996estimation`. Multivariate FH models can be fitted with the R package` msae` ({cite:ts}`permatasari2020msae`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The basic FH model assumes that covariates are population aggregates measured without error. For cases where auxiliary variables are measured with error, {cite:t}`ybarra2008small` offer an extension to the basic FH model to account for the measurement error. Measurement error models can be applied with the R package `saeME` ({cite:t}`mubaraketalsaeme`). This extension is also available in the R package` emdi` ({cite:t}`kreutzmann2019r`).\n",

    "4.  Hierarchical Bayesian methods have been applied` `in the `hbsae` R package by {cite:t}`boonstra2015package`. The `BayesSAE` R package (Shi {cite:t}`shibayes`) also includes Bayesian extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  {cite:t}`halbmeier2019fayherriot` introduced the `fayherriot` Stata command, which allows for adjusting non-positive random effect variance estimates, and allows for transformation of the variable of interest to deal with violations of the model's assumptions. Transformation is also available in the `emdi` package in R ({cite:t}`kreutzmann2019r`)."

    "The FH model is defined in two stages.[^6] In the first stage, the true values of the indicators $\\tau_{d}$ for all the areas $d=1,\\ldots,D$, are linked by establishing a common linear regression model, called the *linking model*, where the true indicator is linearly related to a vector of area-level covariates $\\mathbf{x}_{d}$,\n",

They are assumed to satisfy usual regression assumptions, such as having zero mean and constant variance $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$, which is typically unknown. Note that the linear regression model **Equation {eq}`eq:FHmodel`** cannot be fitted to the data, because true values of the indicators $\\tau_{d}$ are not observed. Direct estimators $\\hat{\\tau}_{d}^{DIR}$ of the indicators are available from the survey microdata but are, obviously, subject to survey error, since they are calculated only with the area-specific survey data, which is of small size. Hence, in the second stage, this survey error is modeled by assuming that the direct estimators are centered around the true values of the indicators, as follows:\n",

    "with heteroscedastic errors, where error variances are $\\mathrm{var\\left(\\mathit{e_{d}|\\tau_{d}}\\right)=\\psi_{\\mathit{d}}}$, $d=1,\\ldots,D$, which is called the *sampling model*. Note that the $D$ error variances $\\psi_{d}$, $d=1,\\ldots,D$, need to be assumed as known even if they are not; otherwise, there would be more unknown parameters than the available observations: $\\hat{\\tau}_{d}^{DIR}$, $d=1,\\ldots,D$. These error variances are customarily estimated based on the survey microdata from the area of interest and perhaps smoothed afterward since these estimates are highly unstable due to the small area sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual small area estimator obtained from this model is based on the *best linear unbiased predictor* (BLUP), which is defined as the linear function $\\hat{\\tau}_{d}=\\mathbf{\\mathbf{\\alpha}'y}$ of the data $\\mathbf{y}=(\\hat{\\tau}_{1}^{DIR},\\ldots,\\hat{\\tau}_{D}^{DIR})'$, where $\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}=(\\alpha_{1},\\ldots,\\alpha_{D})'$, which is unbiased under the model, that is, $E(\\hat{\\tau}_{d}-\\tau_{d})=0$, and is optimal (or *best*) in the sense of minimizing the mean squared error (MSE). The resulting BLUP $\\hat{\\tau}_{d}$ of $\\tau_{d}$ can be expressed as a weighted average of the direct estimator $\\hat{\\tau}_{d}^{DIR}$ and the regression-synthetic estimator, $\\mathbf{x}'_{d}\\hat{\\beta}$, where the weight $\\gamma_{d}=\\sigma_{u}^{2}/(\\sigma_{u}^{2}+\\psi_{d})$ attached to the direct estimator grows as the error variances $\\psi_{d}$ decrease (or the area sample size increases), or the unexplained variation $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ grows. This means that, in areas with a large sample size or when the auxiliary information is not very powerful, the FH estimates come close to the direct estimators; in the opposite case, they come close to the regression-synthetic estimators. This leads to the BLUP automatically borrowing strength only when it is actually needed and approximating to the conventional survey direct estimators when the area sample size is large or the model is not useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BLUP does not require normality assumptions on the model errors or area effects, and it is unbiased under the model. The *empirical* BLUP (EBLUP) is obtained by replacing the unknown area effects' variance $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ by an estimator $\\hat{\\sigma}_{u}^{2}$ with good properties (i.e. consistent). The EBLUP preserves unbiasedness under symmetric distributions and under certain regularity assumptions on the considered estimator $\\hat{\\sigma}_{u}^{2}$ of $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ (and a translation invariant function of the sample data $\\mathbf{y}$), which are satisfied by the usual estimators obtained by ML, REML, or Fay-Herriot's method of moments. However, their exact mean squared error (MSE) does not have a closed form. For this reason, analytical approximations with good properties for **large number of areas** $D$ have been obtained under normality. Similarly, an analytical estimator of the true MSE that is nearly unbiased for large $D$ has been obtained under normality. This MSE estimator depends on the actual estimator of $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ that is applied; for the exact formulas, see {cite:t}`rao2015small`, Section 6.2.1. For areas with moderate or large sample sizes and indicators (and corresponding direct estimators) defined in terms of sums over the area units, the normality assumption is minimally ensured by the Central Limit Theorem. However, for areas with small sample sizes or when target indicators are not defined in terms of sums over the area units, the normality assumption should be validated if these customary MSE estimates are considered; otherwise, they should be interpreted with care.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem that may occur when applying FH models is that the estimated model variance $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ may be non-positive, and then it is customary to set it to zero. In these instances, the weight $\\gamma_{d}$ is equal to 0 for all areas, implying a weight of zero to direct estimates regardless of the area's sample size. Hence, the EBLUP reduces to the synthetic estimator, which may be considerably different to the direct estimator ({cite:t}`rao2015small`). {cite:t}`li2010adjusted` and {cite:t}`yoshimori2014new` propose adjustments to the maximum likelihood approach to obtain strictly positive estimates. These adjustments are incorporated into the `emdi` package in R ({cite:t}`kreutzmann2019r`).\n",
    "\n",
    "A clear drawback of the FH model is that the sampling variances of direct estimators, $\\psi_{d}$, $d=1,\\ldots,D$, are assumed to be known even if they are actually estimated,[^7] and usual MSE estimators do not account for the uncertainty due to estimation of these variances. Note also that, if one wishes to estimate several indicators, a different model needs to be constructed for each indicator, even if they are all based on the same welfare variable. This means that one needs to find area-level covariates that are linearly related to each indicator. It seems more reasonable to fit a model for the considered welfare variable at the unit-level and then estimate all the target monetary indicators based on that same model, as is done in the procedures based on unit-level models described in **Chapter 4: {ref}`unit-level`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the area-level auxiliary information commonly has the shape of area means or proportions. For indicators with a more complex shape than the simple mean welfare, it might be difficult to find area-level covariates that are linearly related with the complex function of welfare for the area; consequently, the linearity assumption in the FH model might fail, and finding an adequate transformation for linearity to hold might not be easy in some applications. In any case, even if the gains obtained using the FH model depend on the explanatory power of the available covariates, {cite:t}`molina_morales2009` observed very mild gains of the EBLUPs of poverty rates and gaps based on the FH model in comparison to those obtained by {cite:t}`molina2010small` using the same data sources, but relying on unit-level models (and using the microdata). When considering indicators, such as the FGT poverty indicators, an additional drawback of the FH model is that due to the small area sample sizes, direct estimators that are equal to zero or one are possible (when no one or everyone is found to be below the poverty line), even if the area sample size is not zero. In those areas, the sampling variances of the direct estimators are also zero and unless a different approach is applied to obtain strictly positive variances, the FH Model is not applicable for those areas. A common approach to correct for this is to remove those areas in the modeling phase and then use a synthetic estimator for that area instead."

    "Even if the area-level model may be applied to produce poverty estimates at a given level of aggregation, one may also wish to aggregate these estimates to higher aggregation levels (let us call these larger areas \"regions\"). While the estimate of the poverty rate for a region is simply the population weighted average of the area-level poverty rates contained within the region, obtaining a correct MSE estimate for the estimator of that region requires aggregating the estimates of the MSEs and mean crossed product errors (MCPEs) at the area level, $d$, up to the regional level, $r$.
