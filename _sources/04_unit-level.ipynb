    "This chapter focuses on unit-level models for small area estimation of poverty, which typically rely on estimating the distribution of the household's welfare, given a set of auxiliary variables or correlates.[^1] The methods presented in this chapter use model-based techniques that \"borrow strength\" from other areas by using a larger data set with auxiliary information -- usually the population census. The resulting indirect estimators sacrifice design bias, but often yield more precise estimates in terms of mean-squared errors (MSE). In software implementations of the method described in this chapter, model parameters are used to simulate multiple welfare vectors from the fitted distribution for all households in the census. This is done because the census often lacks a welfare measure for poverty measurement ({cite:t}`elbers2007poverty`). From the simulated census vectors, it is possible to obtain poverty rates or any other welfare indicator, for every area, including the non-sampled ones. This chapter serves as a guide for the production of unit-level small area estimates of poverty indicators, focusing on two of the most popular approaches -- the one proposed by Elbers, Lanjouw, and Lanjouw ({cite:t}`elbers2003micro`, ELL), and the Empirical Best (EB) approach by Molina and Rao ({cite:t}`molina2010small`, MR).[^2] It presents evidence on certain aspects of SAE and recommendations on what may be the preferred approach in some scenarios and offers advice for aspects where perhaps more research is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapter begins by presenting some of the prerequisites that should be satisfied before commencing a SAE exercise. It provides insights that may help practitioners choose a unit-level SAE method that is adequate for their needs. It then presents considerations that practitioners may keep in mind when conducting SAE, such as data transformation and why ELL has fallen out of favor with many practitioners. Additionally, it presents the usual steps towards selecting a model and the production of small area estimates. The sections rely on real world and simulated data, and offer codes which readers may use to replicate some of the analysis; in other instances it pulls evidence from recent research.[^3]\n"

    "The basic ingredients for model-based unit-level small area estimation for poverty are a contemporaneous survey and census -- ideally from the same year. Small area estimates rely on household-level data to obtain the conditional distribution of welfare given the observed correlates. This information is then used to generate welfare for all the census units. Thus, if characteristics in the two datasets differ considerably, or if the structure of the conditional distribution has changed between the two data sources, then the estimates could be biased and of little use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining a pool of candidate variables for the analysis requires a thorough review of the survey and census data to ensure comparability. In the census and survey questionnaires, questions should be asked in a similarly, ideally worded in the same manner. Checks should then be conducted on the survey weights to understand how these are constructed. For example, in some countries where there is heavy migratory work, household expansion factors (usually the number of household members) may be adjusted by the number of days the individual is present in the dwelling. Such adjustments should also be possible in the census data; otherwise, the poverty estimates obtained from SAE methods will not be comparable to those obtained directly from the survey. Even if questions are asked in a similar fashion and weights are replicable, differences may still arise. Teams are strongly recommended to compare the mean and distribution the potential pool of covariates across the survey and the census -- including whether it is possible to reproduce the direct estimates of poverty produced by the National Statistical Office. Ideally, the mean and distribution of the covariates should be comparable, at least at the aggregation level at which the survey is designed to be representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first decisions that must be made is the level at which estimates must be produced. As noted afterward, this determines the level at which location effects are specified in the model in unit-level models. For reasons that will be apparent in the following sections, the locations in the survey must be matched to the locations in the census. Matching locations will also ensure that when using information from external sources, for example, administrative data or satellite imagery-derived data, these correspond to the correct location. Additionally, the use of hierarchical identifiers for the location variable is recommended ({cite:t}`zhao2006user`). Under Stata's `sae` package, these identifiers must be numeric and no longer than 16 digits,[^4] and should have an equal number of digits for every area. For example, in the hierarchical identifier SSSMMMMPPP, the first 3 digits represent states (S), the next 4 digits represent municipalities (M), and the final 3 digits represent PSUs (P). The use of hierarchical identifiers is necessary for two-fold nested-error models. In the code syntax, the user needs to indicate the number of digits to remove (from the right) to arrive at the larger area's identifier. For example, to go from PSU to municipality level, it is necessary to remove 3 digits, yielding SSSMMMM."

    "The model-based small area estimation methods described in this chapter are dependent on an assumed model. The nested-error model used for small area estimation by ELL ({cite:t}`elbers2003micro`) and MR ({cite:p}`molina2010small`) was originally proposed by {cite:t}`BHF` to produce county-level corn and soybean crop area estimates for the American state of Iowa. For the estimation of poverty and welfare, the ELL and MR methods assume that the transformed welfare $y_{ch}$ for each household $h$ within each location $c$ in the population is linearly related to a $1\\times K$ vector of characteristics (or correlates) $x_{ch}$ for that household, according to the nested-error model: \n",

Finally, $\\beta$ is the $K\\times1$ vector of regression coefficients.[^5]\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main assumptions is that errors are normally distributed. The assumption does not necessarily imply that the transformed welfare (the dependent variable) is normally distributed but instead implies that conditional on the observed characteristics the residuals are normally distributed. Under the assumed model, variation in welfare across the population is determined by three components: the variation in household characteristics, the variation in household-specific unobservables, and the variation in location-specific effects. Within any given area, the welfare distribution is determined by the variation in household specific characteristics and household specific errors."

    "It is important to note that while the method's goal may be to produce headcount poverty rates or other welfare indicators, these are not explicitly modeled in the sense that the dependent variable is welfare (or transformed welfare) and not the desired indicator (e.g. headcount poverty). The methodology relies on approximating as closely as possible the welfare distribution in each area. A model that approximates the welfare distribution poorly may yield a decent estimate for a given poverty line, yet when judged at a different poverty line the method may completely fail. This can be seen in **{numref}`bias_approx`**, where the headcount poverty estimates from the model on the left may work relatively well if the poverty threshold were set at the 70th percentile and yield completely biased estimates at most other thresholds. On the other hand, the model on the right approximates the welfare distribution well in all areas and yields poverty estimates with a small bias across all poverty thresholds and areas."

    "Ideally, the particular model to be used should be aligned to the specific SAE goals. One of the main considerations regarding the model to be used is the level at which poverty estimates will be reported. This will determine the level at which the random location effect should be specified (see **{numref}`unit-level:annex`** for details). Specifying the random effects at a lower level of aggregation than the level at which estimation is desired (e.g., for clusters nested within the areas of interest) will lead to noisier estimates ({cite:t}`marhuenda2017poverty`), albeit with little effect on bias (Corral et al. {cite:t}`corral2021map`). The magnitude by which the MSE of the estimates based on a model with cluster effects instead of area effects will increase depends on the ratio between the variances of the random effects associated to the different locations. If the variance of the random effects of the clusters within areas, $\\sigma_{ac}^{2}$, is larger than that of the area's random effects, $\\sigma_{a}^{2}$, then the MSE may not increase by much. On the other hand, when the variance of the area's random effects is larger, the MSE of the estimates based on a model with only cluster effects worsens considerably. Thus, the random location effect should be at the same level for which estimates will be reported (see **{numref}`Empirical-MSE-comparison`**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, under the latest edition of the Stata `sae` package, practitioners can apply two-fold nested-error models ({cite:t}`marhuenda2017poverty`), besides the traditional one-fold nested-error model. The drawback of the implemented two-fold nested-error model in the Stata `sae` package is that it does not consider survey weights, nor does it consider heteroskedasticity. The benefit from applying a two-fold nested-error model is that the resulting estimates are optimal at two levels of aggregation, because the MSEs of the estimates at both levels tend to be smaller under the assumed model than when using one-fold nested-error models with only cluster or area effects (see **{numref}`Empirical-MSE-comparison`**).\n"

For example, though the underlying assumed model is the same, different model-fitting approaches are applied between ELL and MR approaches. Noise estimates of the small area estimators are also obtained differently.

    "Since the EB method of MR ({cite:t}`molina2010small`) assumes that the errors are normally distributed, data transformation to get a distribution close to normal can lead to less biased and less noisy estimates (see {cite:t}`rao2015small`; {cite:t}`rojas2020data`; {cite:t}`corral2021map`; and {cite:t}`tzavidis2018start`).[^20] More generally, variable transformation to make the assumptions underlying the model hold is one of the main aspects of model-based small area estimation (see Technical Annex of this chapter, **{numref}`unit-level:annex:model`**). Specifically, since the SAE models used often assume normality in the errors, the goal in data transformation is to approximate normally distributed residuals.[^21]\n",
    "\n",
    "Most software packages for small area estimation offer the possibility of data transformation. Perhaps the most popular transformation is the natural logarithm, although it is not always ideal as it can produce left skewed distributions for small values of welfare (see **{numref}`lny`**). Other options include transformation from the Box-Cox family ({cite:t}`bc1964`) and the log-shift transformations, which have the advantage that the transformation parameters may be driven by the specific data at hand ({cite:t}`tzavidis2018start`).The Box-Cox family's transformation parameter, which is the power to be taken, is denoted by $\\lambda$. When $\\lambda=0$, it yields the natural logarithm; otherwise, $\\lambda$ is typically data-driven and chosen to minimize skewness in the dependent variable., which is the power to be taken, is denoted by $\\lambda$. When $\\lambda=0$, it yields the natural logarithm; otherwise, $\\lambda$ is typically data-driven and chosen to minimize skewness in the dependent variable.[^22] A log-shift transformation adds a positive shift to the observed welfare values before taking the log to avoid the left skewness caused by taking the log of very small welfare values. Other options, such as the ordered quantile normalization ({cite:t}`peterson2019ordered`), may generate reliable estimates of headcount poverty, but these transformations are not reversible and therefore they cannot be used to obtain other indicators such as mean welfare, poverty gap, poverty severity among others ({cite:t}`masaki2020small`; {cite:t}`corral2021map`), limiting their applicability. Regardless of the transformation chosen, it is always recommended to check the residuals to determine if these follow the underlying model assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with real-world data, assumptions are often only approximately met ({cite:t}`marhuenda2017poverty`) and effort must be made to find one that approximates the normal distribution best. In simulation studies that seek to validate small area estimation methods based on actual data, data-driven transformations may reduce bias and the noise due to departures from normality (see {cite:t}`corral2021map` and {cite:t}`tzavidis2018start` among others). Using the *Mexican Intercensal survey of 2015* as a 3.9 million household census data, {cite:t}`corral2021map` note that the gains from a transformation of the dependent variable that minimizes skewness can be quite considerable. In the validation exercises conducted in that paper, bias and MSEs, are considerably reduced when using a Box-Cox or a log-shift transformation (see **{numref}`trans_compare`**)."

For the estimation of poverty and welfare, the ELL and MR methods assume the transformed welfare $y_{ch}$ for each household $h$ in the population within each location $c$ is linearly related to a $1\\times K$ vector of characteristics (or correlates) $x_{ch}$ for that household, according to the nested-error model: \n",

Consequently, for any given realization of the population, the random location effect is unlikely to be equal to 0, but its expected value is 0 across all the possible realizations. To see this, a simulation where the random location effects for 80 areas are drawn from a normal distribution $\\eta_{c}\\stackrel{iid}{\\sim}N\\left(0,0.15^{2}\\right)$, is shown in the Stata code snippet below.

    "Note how in the results, the value of the random location effect for a given area and population is not necessarily equal to 0. However, across all the generated populations, the mean value of the random location effect for all areas is very close to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "This aspect is important, because it highlights the key difference between the methodology from ELL ({cite:t}`elbers2003micro`) and the EB approach from MR ({cite:t}`molina2010small`). Under ELL, when simulating welfare for the census, the location effect is drawn exactly as assumed under the model, that is as, $\\eta_{c}\\stackrel{iid}{\\sim}N\\left(0,\\sigma_{\\eta}^{2}\\right)$. In essence, under ELL, for any given area present in the sample, the ELL estimator of the census area mean $\\bar{y}_{c}$ is obtained by averaging the actual area means $\\bar{y}_{c}^{*(m)}=\\bar{X}_{c}'\\beta+\\eta_{c}^{*(m)}+\\bar{e}_{c}^{*(m)}$, $m=1,\\ldots,M$, across $M$ simulated populations, that is, the ELL estimator is $\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{m=1}^{M}\\bar{y}_{c}^{*(m)}$, which approximates $E\\left(\\bar{y}_{c}\\right)$. But note that $E[\\eta_{c}]=0$ and $E[e_{ch}]=0$. Hence, the ELL estimator reduces to the regression-synthetic estimator, $\\bar{X}_{c}'\\beta$ (MR, {cite:t}`molina2010small`). On the other hand, under MR ({cite:t}`molina2010small`), conditioning on the survey sample ensures that the estimator includes the random location effect, since $E[\\bar{y}_{c}|\\eta_{c}]=\\bar{X}_{c}'\\beta+\\eta_{c}$. {cite:t}`doi:https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118814963.ch18` suggests that the inclusion of contextual variables somewhat attenuates the issue. Nevertheless, unless the contextual variables together with the household-level ones fully explain the variation in welfare across areas, there will always be gains from using EB compared to ELL. Actually, the EB approach from {cite:t}`molina2010small` gives approximately the *best* estimator in the sense that it yields the estimator with the minimum mean squared error (MSE) for target areas. Consequently, EB estimators are considerably more efficient than ELL (see {cite:t}`molina2010small`; {cite:t}`corral2020pull`; and {cite:t}`corral2021map`).\n",
    "\n",
    "A census data set of $N=20,000$ observations is created, similar to MR ({cite:t}`molina2010small`), to observe how conditioning on the survey sample affects the resulting small area estimates. Under the created data, all observations are uniformly spread among $C=80$ areas, labeled from 1 to 80. This means that every area consists of $N_{c}=250$ observations. The location effects are simulated as $\\eta_{c}\\stackrel{iid}{\\sim}N\\left(0,0.15^{2}\\right)$; note that every observation within a given area will have the same simulated effect. Then, values of two right-hand side binary variables are simulated. The first one, $x_{1}$, takes a value of 1 if a generated random uniform value between 0 and 1 is less than or equal to $0.3+0.5\\frac{c}{80}$. This means that observations in areas with a higher label are more likely to get a value of 1. The next one, $x_{2}$, is not tied to the area's label. This variable takes the value 1 if a simulated random uniform value between 0 and 1 is less than or equal to 0.2. The census welfare vectors $y_{c}=(y_{c,1},\\ldots,y_{c,N_{c}})^{T}$ for each area $c=1,\\ldots,C$, are then created from the model as follows: $$\\ln(y_{ch})=3+0.03x_{1,ch}-0.04x_{2,ch}+\\eta_{c}+e_{ch},$$ where household-level errors are generated under the homoskedastic setup, as $e_{ch}\\overset{iid}{{\\sim}}N\\left(0,0.5^{2}\\right)$. The poverty line is fixed at $z=12$, corresponding to roughly 60 percent of the median welfare of a generated population. The steps to creating such a population in Stata are shown below:"

Regardless of the shape, the best predictor can be approximated by Monte Carlo simulation ({cite:t}`molina2019desagregacion`). ELL and MR's EB approach clearly differ in the computational procedures used to estimate the indicators of interest and their noise. On the other hand, the original implementation of EB in `PovMap` and the `sae` Stata command used a similar computational approach to ELL. Under ELL and the original EB implementation in `PovMap`, noise and indicator estimates are all obtained with a single computational procedure. {cite:t}`corral2020pull` show that the noise estimates of the original ELL (referred to as variance by the authors) underestimate the true MSE of the indicators, despite ELL estimates being much noisier.

    "The EB method from MR ({cite:t}`molina2010small`) conditions on the survey sample data and thus makes more efficient use of the survey data, which contains the only available (and hence precious) information on the actual welfare. Conditioning on the survey data requires matching households across the survey and census. Matching households was required in the original EB approach introduced in MR ({cite:t}`molina2010small`). However, the census and sample households can not be matched in practice, except in some countries. When linking the two data sources is not possible, this sample may be appended to the population for areas where there is a sample. This is the approach taken in the original EB implementation in the `sae` R package by {cite:t}`molina2015sae`. In order to obtain a Monte Carlo approximation to the EB estimates using this software, estimates are obtained as a weighted average between a simulated census poverty rate for the area and the direct estimate of poverty obtained using the area's sample. When the sample size relative to the population size for a given area is considerable, for example, 20%, using the sample observations of welfare may yield to a considerable gain in MSE. However, as noted in **{numref}`CEBvsEB`** in **{numref}`unit-level:first-sae:model`** the gain in MSE of EB over CensusEB approximates 0 as the sample size by area shrinks. When the sample is 4% of the population per area, an already quite large sample rarely encountered in real-world scenarios, the difference between the approaches is nearly zero.\n",

To obtain point estimates under {cite:t}`molina2010small`, the authors assume that the considered unit-level model is the one that generates the data. Thus, the estimates for $\\beta,$ $\\sigma_{\\eta}^{2}$, and $\\sigma_{e}^{2}$ obtained from the fitted model are kept fixed in the Monte Carlo simulation procedure used to obtain EB point estimates.[^31] Additionally, the predicted random location effects, $\\hat{\\eta}_{c}$, are also kept fixed as a result of conditioning on the sample observations of welfare.\n",

    "[^1]: This section draws from the background papers for these guidelines. See {cite:t}`corral2020pull` and {cite:t}`corral2021map`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^2]: A factor that likely contributed to the expansion of these methods is the availability of software, which can be easily used to apply these approaches; `PovMap` ({cite:t}`zhao2006user`) for ELL and R's `sae` package ({cite:t}`molina2015sae`). While other methods exist, for the purposes of this section, attention is given to the methods noted.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^3]: It is highly recommended that novice practitioners start by reading **{numref}`unit-level:prep:assumed`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^4]: Stata's double-precision only goes up to 16 digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^5]: Additional information is provided in the technical annex **{numref}`unit-level:annex`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^6]: Interested readers can refer to Stata's documentation to learn more about mixed models.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^7]: To see the help file in Stata type: `help sae_ebp `for the one-fold nested-error model.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^8]: CensusEB estimates are similar to EB estimates, but do not include survey observations when calculating small area estimates. See {cite:t}`molina2019desagregacion` or {cite:t}`corral2020pull` for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^9]: To see help file in Stata type: `help sae_ebp2 `for the two-fold nested-error model.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^10]: Methods that do not consider the survey sampling weights may in turn include covariates that capture the sampling/response mechanism, trying to correctly model their relationship to the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^11]: To see help file in Stata type: `help sae_mc_bs `for the one-fold nested-error model fit with Henderson's method III heteroskedasticity and survey weights (see {cite:t}`van2014gls`).\n",
    "\n",
    "[^12]: Readers may refer to {cite:t}`elbers2002micro` or {cite:t}`nguyen2018sae` for a full exposition of the alpha model for heteroskedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^13]: The adaptation was made in light of criticism regarding the fitting method described in ELL ({cite:t}`elbers2002micro`). See {cite:t}`nguyen2018sae` for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^14]: Ensuring the use of same area identifiers is still recommended for the inclusion of area-level variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^15]: To see help file in Stata type: `help sae_ell `for the one-fold nested-error model fit with heteroskedasticity and survey weights (see {cite:t}`van2014gls`).\n",
    "\n",
    "[^16]: {cite:t}`corral2020pull` discuss the differences between the methods used for noise estimation and how the methods fare when applied to simulated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^17]: **{numref}`unit-level:annex`** gives a more detailed explanation on the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^18]: Empirical MSE are obtained from multiple samples. Under model-based simulations, the sample is kept fixed, and across populations the only difference is in the errors. Under design-based simulations, multiple samples are taken from a single (fixed) population.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^19]: In areas with no information (areas not sampled), EB and ELL estimates are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^20]: The implementation of the ELL method in PovMap allowed practitioners to draw errors from the empirical distribution, which in principle may benefit the method when normality does not hold. Nevertheless, when comparing CensusEB method (assuming normal errors) and ELL method (drawing errors from the empirical distribution) in a model-based simulation experiment, where the model errors used to generate the populations were drawn from a Student's t-distribution, CensusEB outperformed ELL by a considerable margin (see {cite:t}`corral2020pull`).\n",
    "\n",
    "[^21]: In cases where, even after transformation, the deviation is apparent only in isolated observations or isolated areas, models based on mixtures of normal distributions may be used. To estimate poverty and inequality indicators, a mixture may be specified as done by {cite:ts}`elbers2014estimation`. {cite:t}`mixMolina` extend the EB procedure to a multivariate mixture model that incorporates heterogeneity in the regression coefficients apart from the variance components. The proposed model was used to estimate FGT0 and FGT1 by gender in West Bank and Gaza.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^22]: R packages `sae` ({cite:t}`molina2015sae`) and `emdi` ({cite:t}`kreutzmann2019r`) also incorporate transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^23]: Refer to the help files for `bcskew0` and `lnskew0` to learn more about the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^24]: An alternative approach to modeling heteroskedasticity is to consider a random coefficient model similar to the one studied in {cite:t}`hobza2013small` and applied to the estimation of mean income. However, the method has not been implemented in any software.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^25]: The example shows lower bias and a smaller MSE for a particular data set and could not translate equally to other data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^26]: Heteroskedasticity may be checked by plotting residuals against predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^27]: In terms of alternatives, the R package `mcmcsae` ({cite:t}`mcmcsae`) can also model heteroskedasticity in terms of covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^28]: It is advisable to split the processes across multiple do files, because model selection, as well as simulating welfare in the cesus and obtaining small area estimates for all areas is not computationally negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^29]: Note Stata cannot open this data file as a regular dta file.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^30]: For the full exposition, see {cite:ts}`corral2020pull`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^31]: Note that this is considerably different from the approach that was implemented in `PovMap` {cite:t}`corral2020pull`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^32]: See {cite:t}`corral2020pull` for more details.\n",
